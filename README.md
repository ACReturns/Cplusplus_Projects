 # Cplusplus_Projects
This is an ongoing compilation of C++ projects I wanted to put together. Tackling both games and applications to build more experience with the language as a whole.   


1. [Rock, Paper, Scissors](#RPS)


## RPS
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the ability to rematch the AI until you wish to to quit. It tracks the score of both players with nobody earning a point if there is a draw.
